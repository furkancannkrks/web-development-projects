    <h1>12 Angry Men</h1>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young Latin American man is accused of murder for killing his father. A knife, which the accused says he lost, was found in the room where the murder took place, the defence presented by the young man to the court is weak and there are many witnesses who say they heard what happened. If found guilty, the accused will be sentenced to death. Out of 12 jurors, only juror number eight, Davis, voted for a verdict of 'not guilty'. As Davis tries to persuade the jurors, it becomes clear that each juror has different personal reasons for voting 'guilty', including xenophobia, overconfidence in the law, conformity to the majority, and reckoning with the past.
