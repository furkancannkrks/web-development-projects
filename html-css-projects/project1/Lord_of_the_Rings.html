    <h1>The Lord of the Rings : Return of the Kings</h1>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sauron's armies grow and grow. Frodo and his dear friend Sam are in the midst of a fearful journey, approaching the terrible Mordor step by step. The one ring must be destroyed and goodness is ready to fight for it. In the background, armies of men, elves and dwarves are united against the forces of darkness, despite their ancient enmity. All of them are looking at the hand of a tiny Hobbit and his abilities.
