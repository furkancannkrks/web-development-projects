    <h1>Fight Club</h1>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack is an insurance clerk who is caught up in the mundanity of life. He has been suffering from insomnia for a long time. He attends group therapies in order to get rid of his psychological problems. During the therapies, he meets a girl named Marla. After a while, he meets Tyler Durden, who will change his life. Durden is a man who has achieved all the goals Jack wants to achieve and will introduce Jack to the 'Fight Club', an organisation that should never be talked about.
